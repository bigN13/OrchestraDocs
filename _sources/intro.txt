Intro
===================================================

Orchestra is a composable shell that allows developers to skip the
process of writing a custom framework for every application they have to
write. This way it is possible to focus on the actual business problem
that needs to be solved instead of writing a framework again and again.

The biggest advantage is that the core is maintained by open-source
developers so you will get improvements and new features by simply
updating to a new version.

Orchestra uses several well-known external libraries to make sure it can
provide the quality expected from such a framework:

-   AvalonDock (docking library)
-   Catel (MVVM framework)
-   FluentRibbon (ribbon)
-   Prism (modularity)

Orchestra consists of a main shell including an SDK with services that
allows developers to communicate with the shell. Developers can write
their own modules which implement the actual functionality of their
application. These modules can communicate with the shell, but also with
each other through the services that are offered out of the box.
